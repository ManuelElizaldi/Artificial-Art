# Introduction
In this project I explore the idea: what if art can serve as inspiration for AI just as art inspires me. Take paintings from different museum APIs and then run those through different image generator AI and trasnforming them into new art pieces. 
*Art Institute of Chicago API*
https://api.artic.edu/docs/

APIs I want to use in the future:
- *MET museum API* : https://metmuseum.github.io/

- *Harvard Museum API* : https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docsssssssxd

# Image Generation Engine:
*DALLÂ·E to generate an AI image*
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage

# Repo I want to explore:
https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a

Some other APIs I want to explore:
*Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum Collections*
